The 'examples' directory:

This directory contains the following scripts that would be
your quickest way to become familiar with this module:

1.    ticket_preprocessor_and_doc_modeler.pl

2.    retrieve_similar_tickets.pl


Run the first script to see ticket preprocessing and doc
modeling being carried out on the (fake) tickets stored in
the Excel file ExampleExcelFile.xls in this directory.

Next, run the second script to retrieve five tickets that
are closest to the query ticket whose integer is supplied to
the retrieve_similar_tickets_with_vsm()> method in the
script.

If both scripts run fine, go through the statements in the
scripts to see how you need to sequence the different
preprocessing, doc modeling, and retrieval steps for your
tickets.

IMPORTANT1: The spreadsheet 

                        ExampleExcelFile.xls 

            is contrived.  Do not draw any conclusions about 
            the retrieval precision of this module based on
            the tickets in this file.

IMPORTANT2: You need to set the parameter 

                           min_idf_threshold 

            with care in the retrieve_similar_tickets.pl script.
            See the comment block in that script.  In general, its
            value will depend on how many tickets there are in your
            spreadsheet.
