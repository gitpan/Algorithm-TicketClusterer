#  This is the list of stop words --- these are words that
#  will be deleted from the tickets clustering data before
#  the addition of synonyms for the words.

#  Do not include the words 'no' and 'not' in this list
#  as these are needed for the detection of words whose
#  antonyms are required.

#  After the above preprocessing step, we want to eliminate
#  words like 'no' and 'not' because their synonym set
#  includes words such as the "atomic number" that have
#  nothing do with the sort of tickets we are talking about.
