#  This is the list of stop words --- these are words that
#  will be deleted from the tickets clustering data before
#  the addition of synonyms for the words.

#  IMPORTANT: 

#  Do not include the words 'no' and 'not' in this list
#  as these are needed for the detection of words whose
#  antonyms are required.
